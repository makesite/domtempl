		<h1>Blog - Other templating engines</h1>
		<div><h2>DOM-based</h2>

<h3>XTemplate (PHP)</h3>

<p>I found this one while working on initial versions of DOMtempl
and considered using it. I decided against it, in the end, as my
vision was a little bit different.</p>

<p>XTemplate relies on comments, more specifically, commands
hidden in the comments. I don't know if they use DOM or string
parsing for that, but either way it's rather clever.</p>

<p>Due to this mechanism, it can also parse specific parts of the
template by request, and not necessary the whole thing at once.</p>

<h3>DOMTemplate (PHP)</h3>

<p>This one is a close cousin. Found it way into DOMtempl's life.
Was surprised to read the thinking behind it. Way better writing,
than anything I could ever come up with to explain the darn
thing!</p>

<p>The main difference is that it advocates direct DOM manipulation
from the controller. I think that's too excessive.</p>

<h3>MELD3 (Python)</h3>

<p>This one is elegant! They use namespacing (instead of data-attributes
like DOMtempl does) to sprinkle meaning into the templates, and I
instantly fell in love with that idea.</p>

<p>Namespaces make much more sense, from all points of view, to use with
extra templating attributes.</p>

<p>But PHP's support for DOM *NS functions was bad at the time, so I decided
not to pursue it.</p>

<p>Another difference is that they decided not to build up a tree, but 
a flat table with meld:id. I believe that's underusing the power of DOM,
which gives you a tree naturally.</p>

<h2>String-based</h2>

<h3>Mustache</h3>

<p>Although I swear by DOM-templating and curse loudly when string-based
templating is mentioned, it, of course, has it's uses (text/plain e-mail
notifications, anyone?).</p>

<p>Out of all the engines, I naturally prefer those, that do not allow me
to inject any code, and maintain the view/controller separation. Mustache,
and it's family of derivatives, is a pretty good choice in that regard.</p>

<p>Additionally, it's easy to read, it builds-up paths, and it's tailored to
JSON-like data structures.</p>

<h3>PHPsoup</h3>

<p>Vanilla PHP templating, i.e.:<code>&lt;b&gt;&lt;? echo $title; ?&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</code>. This is a 
scourge of php, hated by most. When used correctly, can be quite
nice and unobtrusive, as proven by many modern PHP frameworks.</p>

<p>Still, the temptation to write direct php into those is too large to 
overcome and I've yet to see a project that didn't succumb to it at one
point or another.</p>

<p>Those are also the fastest (for PHP) and nothing will ever beat them
in speed. That is way many engines have an ability to "compile" their
templates into phpsoup.</p>

<h3>ERB (Ruby)</h3>

<p>I didn't understand this one. What purpose would such an obscure syntax
serve? Is there a term "rubysoup"? Because that's what it is. Way too much 
logic.</p>

<p>P.S. No offense to other templating engines intended, just trying to express
my reasoning for creating Yet Another One. If you <em>must</em> quote me bad-mouthing
someone, tho, here you go: Smarty (PHP) can go fuck itself.</p>
